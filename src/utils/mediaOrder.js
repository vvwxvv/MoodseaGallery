/**
 * mediaOrder.js — generic helpers for JSON `order` fields.
 *
 * TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS. Both are "a position for a page", but on different
 * records, so never mix them up:
 *
 *   Artwork.order  → where an ARTWORK sits on a page
 *     { artist_page_order, exhibition_page_order, art_fair_page_order }
 *     Driver: artist page "Related Artworks" (artist_page_order), the
 *     exhibition page's artwork list (exhibition_page_order), the fair page's
 *     artwork list (art_fair_page_order). Ordered in Manager → Artwork → Order.
 *
 *   Image.order    → where an IMAGE sits on a page
 *     { rolling_img_order, artist_detail_rolling_img_order,
 *       exhibition_page_order, art_fair_page_order,
 *       artist_page_order (LEGACY — no longer offered, kept so old rows keep
 *       their value) }
 *     Driver: the artist page's rolling slideshow (rolling_img_order), the
 *     artist DETAIL page's rolling slideshow
 *     (artist_detail_rolling_img_order), the exhibition page's image gallery,
 *     the fair page's image gallery.
 *     Ordered in Manager → Image → Order.
 *
 * Two rolling sequences on purpose: the artists index / artist page preview and
 * the artist detail page's slideshow are separate surfaces, so each keeps its
 * own per-artist order (and its own hide flag — see utils/markRegistry).
 *
 * The artist page shows images ONLY as the rolling sequence, which is why the
 * image side has no separate "artist page order" tab any more: its legacy
 * `artist_page_order` values are read last as a fallback (see useImageGallery)
 * and are never written by the manager.
 *
 * Legacy rows still have a plain string `order`; every helper tolerates that
 * (a string is treated as the value for whatever key is asked).
